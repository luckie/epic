# Epic Content Microservice
##### A minimalist content management system (CMS) API that persists content as JSON to a database.  It is scalable, device-agnostic, extremely performant, and does not impose any architectural constraints upon the user experience that is using it.  Epic is a Go language program that is compiled into a platform-specific native binary, and usually deployed as a Docker container.  It automatically deploys using no-cost zero-administration [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) TLS certificates (SSL).

##### Epic is not for everyone - especially not for fans of WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla.  Epic is for technically-savvy developers who can not express their creativity, while being constrained by traditional CMS limitations and tradeoffs.  99% of those using a traditional CMS should not even consider using Epic, because Epic assumes a robust modern client-side development skill set.

##### Epic addresses a very specific niche that other CMS have not successfully fulfilled.  The inception of Epic was motivated by the need for a fully-functional open source CMS designed from the ground up to drive highly-customized ultra-rich user experiences that are delivered to end users via modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Ember, Angular, React) and native mobile apps (e.g. iOS and Android).  The CMS would have to play nice with unrelated systems supported by the client - never getting in the way; never forcing unrelated systems to do things "the Epic way".

##### The Epic API is benefiting from rapid development, and new features are being released regularly.  Accordingly, it is subject to change without warning.  Once it stabilizes, the Epic API will follow semantic versioning.

**The Epic database connection string must be included as the first parameter.**
e.g. ```postgres://username:password@localhost/epic?sslmode=disable```

**The Epic host URL string must be included as the second parameter.**
e.g. ```example.com``` or ```epic.example.com```

A port number may optionally be included as the third parameter for HTTP (not HTTPS).
If the port number is not specified, the server will default to HTTPS on port 443.
If a port number other than 443 is specified, the server will use HTTP on the specified port.
Any port number below 1025 requires administrative privileges (sudo).

**Here is an example of launching Epic using TLS (HTTPS):**
```
sudo epic postgres://username:password@localhost/epic?sslmode=disable example.com
```

**Here is an example of launching Epic without TLS (HTTP) on port 8080:**
```
epic postgres://username:password@localhost/epic?sslmode=disable example.com 8080
```

## Database Setup

```
CREATE USER epic WITH PASSWORD 'epic';
CREATE DATABASE epic OWNER epic WITH ENCODING='UTF8';
CREATE SCHEMA epic;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "epic" to epic;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA epic TO epic;
```

## Content Management

### Read Content
HTTP GET request to ""/content/{id}"

### Create Content
Requires authorization
HTTP POST request with JSON body to "/content"
```
{
  "app-id":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
  "name":"Left side-bar, bottom",
  "description":"Text that appears at the bottom of the left side-bar."
}
```
Responds with an HTTP Response Code and JSON body that either has the new Content ID or an error message.
```
{
  "id":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"
}
```

### Update Content
Requires authorization
HTTP PUT request with JSON body to "/content/{id}"
```
{
  "id":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
  "locale":"us-EN",
  "data": {
    "id":"123",
    "your-data":"whatever-you-want"
  }
}
```

- Only top-level fields are used by Epic.
- The top-level id must be a UUID V4.
- The top-level 'locale' must be a valid locale string.
- The top-level 'tags' must be valid JSON consisting of an array of strings.
- Any valid JSON can go into the top-level 'data' field.  Epic stores 'data' exactly as is, and does not use it use.  It is your content.
- Relationships between 'content' records are established by applying one or more 'tags'.

### Read All Content Associated With A Specific Tag

The app-uuid is a standard version 4 UUID.

### Create Tag
